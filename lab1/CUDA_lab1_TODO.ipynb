All major Python libraries like **Tensorflow**, **Scikit-learn**, **PyTorch**, **Pandas**, etc. are pre-installed. Google Colab requires no configuration, you only need a **Google Account** and then you are good to go. Your notebooks are stored in your **Google Drive**, or can be loaded from **GitHub**.
